# Singleton Design Pattern

Type : Creational Design Pattern

Objective: Only one object per class

Ex:

1) Preferences of User - Doesn't change frequently - one per user.
2) Printer Queue.
3) Software Driver of a device.

Single Object is globally accessible within the program.

How to make sure that only one instance is created for a class -

Have a private constructor.
Declare a class variable -  uniqueInstance - private access modifier. so that it can be modified only within the class

Have a public method which will create a instance of this class if and only if it is not instantiated before.

```java
public class ExampleSingleton {
  // lazy object construction
  private static ExampleSingleton uniqueIns=null;

  private ExampleSingleton()
  {

  }
  public static ExampleSingleton getInstance()
  {
    if(uniqueIns == null)
    {
      uniqueIns = new ExampleSingleton();

    }

    return uniqueIns;

  }
}
```

Lazy creation - Object of a class is not created until it's needed.

Trade-off: Multithreaded program - concurrent access of shared object by multiple threads.

__Motto__: "To provide global access to a class that is restricted to one instance".
