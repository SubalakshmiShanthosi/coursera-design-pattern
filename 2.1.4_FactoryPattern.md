# Factory Design Pattern

Type: Creational

Objective: Create objects.

Example:
Online store that sells knifes.
Two types of knife - ChefKnife and SteakKnife.

Superclass - Knife
Subclass - ChefKnife, SteakKnife

Method: orderKnife -
 ```java
Knife orderKnife(String knifeType)
{
  Knife knife;
  if(knifeType.equals("chefs"))
  {
    knife = new ChefKnife();
  }
  else if(knifeType.equals("steak"))
  {
    knife = new SteakKnife();
  }
  // preparing knife
  knife.sharpen();
  knife.polish();
  knife.package();

  return knife;
}
 ```

 Concreate instantiation - creation of instance of specific type for a class during instantiation.

 New knifes are added - __List of conditional grows__

Instead of creating knife instance in store - somewhere else.

___Delegate object creation responsibility to KnifeFactory___.

```java

public class KnifeFactory {

  public Knife createKnife(String knifeType)
  {
    Knife knife= null;
    if(knifeType.equals("chefs"))
    {
      knife = new ChefKnife();
    }
    else if(knifeType.equals("steak"))
    {
      knife = new SteakKnife();
    }
    return knife;
  }
}

public class KnifeStore{

  private KnifeFactory knifeFacIns;

  public KnifeStore(KnifeFactory facIns)
  {
    knifeFacIns = facIns;
  }

  public Knife orderKnife(String knifeType)
  {
    Knife knife;
    knife = knifeFacIns.createKnife(knifeType);
    knife.sharpen();
    knife.polish();
    knife.package();
    return knife;
  }
}

```

__Benefits of Factory__: Multiple clients need to instantiate same set of classes, then by using a Factory object, you can cut out redundant code and make the software easily modifiable.

Client code needs only a knife instance to satisfy it's requirement, Knife concrete instantiation is not done- does changes in the knife type can be done without affecting the client method.
Coding to the interface not implementation.
Generalisation of knife creation.

__Factory Method Pattern__:

The factory method design intent is to define an interface for creating objects, but let the subclasses decide which object to instantiate.

```java
public abstract class KnifeStore
{
  public Knife orderKnife(String knifeType)
  {
    Knife knife = createKnife(knifeType);
    knife.sharpen();
    knife.polish();
    knife.package();
    return knife;
    }
  abstract Knife createKnife(String knifeType);
}

public class BudgetKnifeStore extends KnifeStore
{
  Knife createKnife(String knifeType)
  {
    if(knifeType.equals("chefs"))
    {
      return new BudgetChefsKnife();
    }
    else if(knifeType.equals("steak"))
    {
      return new BudgetSteakKnife();
    }
    else
    return null;
  }
}

```
